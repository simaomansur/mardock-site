          I design and build full-stack web applications with clean architecture and modern tooling.

          I build small data workflows, integrations, and automations that save time and reduce manual work.
          Whether it’s processing files, cleaning data, or connecting multiple systems together, I aim for simple, reliable solutions.</p>
        <p>Examples: data ingestion scripts, analytics helpers, automating repetitive tasks, connecting APIs.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a computer science grad who enjoys building real, working software. I’ve worked across
      backend systems, frontend development, and data engineering. I like taking ideas from early
      concept to something you can actually ship and rely on.
