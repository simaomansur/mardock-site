        <h3>Web Applications</h3>
        <p>
          I design and build full-stack web applications with clean architecture and modern tooling.
          From concept to deployment, I focus on stability, performance, and making sure the app is something people actually enjoy using.</p>
        <p>Examples: custom dashboards, tools for businesses, small SaaS products, internal utilities.</p>

        <h3>Data & Automation</h3>
        <p>
          I build small data workflows, integrations, and automations that save time and reduce manual work.
          Whether it’s processing files, cleaning data, or connecting multiple systems together, I aim for simple, reliable solutions.</p>
        <p>Examples: data ingestion scripts, analytics helpers, automating repetitive tasks, connecting APIs.</p>

      <div class="service-card">
        <h3>Personal & Small Business Websites</h3>
        <p>
          I create clean, modern websites for individuals and small businesses who want a professional online presence without the complexity.
          Simple, fast, easy to update, and tailored to the person or brand.</p>

  <section class="section about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a software developer who likes building real projects and learning by doing. 
      I finished my computer science degree and I am now working on my master’s through Georgia Tech. 
      Most of what I know comes from actually building things, breaking them, fixing them, and getting better each time.
      I started Mardock LLC so I could take on small client work and keep growing through real projects. 
      I enjoy working on web apps, data work, and clean websites for people who want something simple and reliable. 
      I try to keep things straightforward and focus on writing software that solves a problem instead of overcomplicating it. 
      Outside of client work, I spend a lot of time building my own projects. Beat Layer has been my main one lately, 
      along with a few smaller tools that help musicians and small businesses. I like having a mix of personal projects and client 
      work because it keeps me improving and gives me space to try new ideas.
